I've been running my personal blog for 22 years.

At first, it was a bunch of HTML pages edited by my hands, and so called
"Kawaii book" - a micro web board written in Perl programming language.
It was hosted on my sysadmin circle's web server, on
[UltraSPARC II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UltraSPARC_II) running Solaris 8.
I migrated it to use PHP and MySQL, and then Tattertools. I finally moved it to
use Wordpress to resolve database migration issue. During all the migration,
I moved it to another circle's web server, and then to a dedicated VM.
